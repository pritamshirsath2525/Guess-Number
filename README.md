# Number Guessing Game
In the project "NUMBER GUESSING GAME"

1.The system generates a random number in between 1 to 100.

2.The user is prompted to enter their given number in a displayed dialogue box

3.If we can't guess the number, we can give up and then the computer tells us the number.

4.We can play it for multiple times using "play again" option

The computer then tells if the entered number matches the guesses number or it is higher/lower than the generated number.
